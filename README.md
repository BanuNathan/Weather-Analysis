# Web-Design-Challenge

#The purpose of this project is to analyze the weather changes as you get closer to the equator.
#To accomplish this analysis we first gathered data from OpenWeatherMap API for over 500 cities.
         
#After analysing the data set we used matplotlib to plot various aspect of the data vs. Latitude.
#Factors we looked at included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed and humidity. This site provides
#source data and visualizations as part of the analysis as well as explations and descriptions of any trends
#and correlations
