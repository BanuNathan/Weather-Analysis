### The purpose of this project is to analyze the weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis I first gathered data from OpenWeatherMap API for over 500 cities.
         
### After analysing the data set I used matplotlib to plot various aspect of the data vs. Latitude. Factors I looked at included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed and humidity. This site provides source data and visualizations as part of the analysis as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations
