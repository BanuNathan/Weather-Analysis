### The purpose of this project is to analyze the weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis we first gathered data from OpenWeatherMap API for over 500 cities.
         
### After analysing the data set we used matplotlib to plot various aspect of the data vs. Latitude. Factors we looked at included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed and humidity. This site provides source data and visualizations as part of the analysis as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations
